<- ORIGINAL EAGLERCRAFT README BELOW ->

eaglercraft is an AOT compiled port of mojang's minecraft 1.5.2 designed to run in an html5/javascript environment, using TeaVM and my opengl 1.3 emulator to simulate a desktop java enviroment fully compatible with minecraft java edition

§1this §1was §1created §1by §1calder §1young §1(lax1dude)§r

§4project §4currently §4maintained §4by §4ayunami2000§r

compiling the javascript and emulating the JRE is largely made possible by the TeaVM project, created by Alexey Andreev and is available for free at §nhttp://teavm.org/§r under Apache License 2.0

eaglercraft makes use of baislsl's java PNG decoder, which is available at §nhttp://github.com/baislsl/PNG§r under MIT License. eaglercraft also makes use of jCraft's jzlib port, available at §nhttp://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/§r under BSD-style licensing.

all graphical assets in this project were ripped from mojang's official minecraft.jar for minecraft version 1.5.2 and they are mojang's intellectual property. assets ommitted include the minecraft soundtrack and music disks and all software references to the mojang/minecraft api.

eaglercraft servers are powered by md_5's BungeeCord and the CraftBukkit project available at §nhttps://bukkit.org/§r. BungeeCord has been modified to accept eaglercraft's strange login packets and to host a websocket server to translate browser connections to raw TCP that vanilla minecraft servers can understand. All java plugins designed for CraftBukkit 1.5.2 are compatible with this configuration.
